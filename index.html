                <h2>His life</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Dog’s are often described as “Man’s best friend” and if you have been around for a couple of years, I’m sure you have come across several stories about them. From rescue dogs saving lives to a heartfelt reunion with its owner, there have been many stories shared on the internet, TV and other media. For the people of Japan, one story however has been circulating for nearly a hundred years: It is the story of Hachiko, an Akita Dog born in the year of 1923 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_(dog)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(learn more about the Akita Dog Breed on Wikipedia)</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>He was brought to Tokyo by Hidesaburo Ueno, which taught at the local Imperial University and both of them immediately became unseparable. Professor Ueno commuted to the University each day via train from the local Shibuya rail station, and a couple of months, Hachiko started to pick him up at said station, not just once or twice, but every single day. A brilliant show of a friendship between a dog and its owner.</p>

                <h2>His loyalty</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Sadly, this didn’t last forever. On May 25th, 1925, Professor Ueno did not return from the University, no matter how long Hachiko waited for him. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while at work and died. Hachiko however, kept waiting for him on the next day. And the day after that. And the day after that day. For more than nine years, Hachiko kept coming to the station, waiting for Professor Ueno to descend the trains.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After his owner’s death, Hachiko was taken in by Professor Ueno’s former gardener, Kozaburo Kobayashi, but continued his daily walk to Shibuya station, where people soon started to take notice of him. At first, he got mostly unfriendly reactions from the Shibuya Train Station Staff and got harassed by other Passengers, but after a former Student of the Professor and an Akita breed expert, Hirokichi Saito wrote an article in 1932 about his story, Hachiko became a national sensation overnight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>His Story was impressing many people with his loyalty and perseverance, and raised new interest in the Akita dog breed, of which only 30 pure breeds remained at that time. Not much later, in 1934, an artist by the name of Teru Ando created a statue of Hachiko near Shibuya station. And of course, Hachiko attended its reveal.</p>

                <h2>His Legacy</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Hachiko passed away on March 8th, 1935 in the streets of Shibuya and was later reunited with Professor Ueno at his family grave in Aoyama Cemetery. His fur was preserved and can still be viewed at Tokyo’s National Science Museum in Ueno.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Even today, the story of his faithfulness and loyalty is taught at schools as an example of important values that should be upheld in life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During World War 2, the Statue in his honor by artist Teru Ando was melted down to fuel the war effort, however, a couple of years after the war had ended, his son Takeshi took it upon himself to build a second statue, which can still be seen near the ever changing scenery of Shibuya Station.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Today, the statue is still a tourist attraction that can be visited, so if you ever get the chance to come to Shibuya, you shouldn’t sleep on at least taking a picture of Hachiko. You can find the location below.</p>
