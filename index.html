                <h2>Man's best friend</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>
                    Dog’s are often described as “Man’s best friend” and if you have been around for a couple of years, I’m sure you have come across several stories about them. From rescue dogs saving lives to a heartfelt reunion of one with its owner, there have been many stories shared on the internet, TV and other media. For the people of Japan, one story however has been circulating for nearly a hundred years: It is the story of Hachiko, an Akita Dog born in the year of 1923 (learn more about the Akita Dog Breed here).
                    <br><br>
                    He was brought to Tokyo by Hidesaburo Ueno, which taught at the local Imperial University. Ueno-san commuted to the University each day via train from the local Shibuya rail station.
                    After a few months, Hachiko started to pick his owner up at said station, not just once or twice, but every single day. It was a beautiful friendship between a dog and its owner.

                <h2>The Tragedy</h2>

                <p>
                    However, on May 25th, 1925, Ueno-san did not return from the University, no matter how long Hachiko waited for him. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while at work and died. Hachiko however, kept waiting for him on the next day. And the day after that. And the day after that day. For more than nine years, Hachiko kept coming to the station, waiting for Ueno-san to descend the trains.
                    <br><br>
                    Hachiko was taken in by Ueno-san’s former gardener, Kozaburo Kobayashi, but continued his daily walk to Shibuya station, where people soon started to take notice of him. One of Ueno-san’s former students Hirokichi Saito, an Akita breed expert who visited Hachiko on several occasions, wrote an article in 1932 about his story and made Hachiko a national sensation overnight. Impressing many people with his loyalty and perseverance, his story was even taught at schools as an example of important values to strive for in life. It even raised new interest in the Akita dog breed, of which only 30 pure breeds remained at that time. Not much later, in 1934, an artist by the name of Teru Ando created a statue of Hachiko near Shibuya station, and of course, Hachiko attended the reveal.

                <h2>His Legacy</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>
                    On March 8th, 1935, Hachiko died at the age of 11 in a street in Shibuya. His remains were burned and buried at Aoyama Cemetery, Minato, Tokyo beside his beloved owner Ueno-san. He was finally reunited with him again after all those years. His fur was preserved and can still be seen in the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo.
                    <br><br>
                    But even though Hachiko was dead, his loyalty lived on and there was also his statue, which sadly got melted down during World War 2, so the metal could be used. This wasn’t the end of it though, because in 1948, Takeshi Ando, the son of the artist of the first statue, build another one, and it has stood in the ever changing area of Shibuya in Tokyo since then as a constant reminder of Hachiko’s life.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, the statue is a tourist attraction that can be visited, so if you ever get the chance to come to Shibuya, you shouldn’t sleep on at least taking a picture of Hachiko. You can find the location below.
