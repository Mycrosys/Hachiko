                <hr><br>
                <p>Two movies were made about the Story of Hachiko. The First one, Hachiko Monogatari (The Story of Hachiko), can be seen on the left, is the Japanese movie released in 1987 by Director Seijirô Kôyama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093132/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(IMDB)</a>. It is the closest adaptation of the true story and won 2 Japanese prizes as feature film and for the Art direction. It is currently only available in Japanese.</p>

                <hr><br>
                <p>The second movie is based on the first and was released in 2009. It was directed by Lasse Hallström <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(IMDB)</a> and starred Richard Gere and Joan Allen. While the overall story of Hachiko stays the same, this is an Americanized version of the above story, taking place not in Japan but the United States. Things were changed to make this a more family friendly movie, but it is definitely worth a watch nevertheless, especially if you don’t like subtitles. This movie is available dubbed in many languages and is more widely available.</p>

                <h2>Hachiko Waits: Based on a True Story</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>For our younger readers there are 2 books about Hachiko’s Story I would like to recommend. The first one is written by Lesléa Newman and is targeting readers between the age of 8-10.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p class="text-quote">"What a good dog you are. What a fine dog you are. Hachi, you are the best dog in all of Japan.
                    Professor Ueno speaks these words to his faithful dog before boarding the train to work every morning. And every afternoon, just before three o'clock, Hachi is at the train station to greet his beloved master. One day, the train arrives at the station without the professor. Hachi waits."</p>

                <hr><br>
                <p>There is also the 32 Page long Paperback by Pamela S. Turner with Illustrations. It’s told from the third party view of a boy named Kentaro and is targeting readers between the age of 4-7. Both books are available in English.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p class="text-quote">"Imagine walking to the same place every day, to meet your best friend. Imagine watching hundreds of people pass by every morning and every afternoon. Imagine waiting, and waiting, and waiting. For ten years. This is what Hachiko did.
                    Hachiko was a real dog who lived in Tokyo, a dog who faithfully waited for his owner at the Shibuya train station long after his owner could not come to meet him."</p>
