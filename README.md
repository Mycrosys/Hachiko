-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colors used are a blue greyish, a creamy white and an orange tone. The grey and white are used to fit in with the black and white pictures, while the orange represents a color tone that can be seen in the modern day Akita dog breed and is used to highlight certain elements like links and headers.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Quattrocento-Sans font is used as the main font for the whole website with Helvetica, Arial and  sans-serif as fallback fonts in case the font doesn't import correctly. It is a very easy to read font and does fit the site well, not taking away from the overall design or the image/movie elements.
        -   To complement this, Quattrocento is used as a main header font. Because it is from the same family, it pairs exceptionally well with Quattrocento-Sans. Its backup fonts are Garamond and Times New Roman.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The site contains a large background hero image (reduced on smaller devices) to immediately capture the attention of the visitor. It contains two cover text, one repeating the name Hachiko with the Japanese writing over it and one with the subtitle "A Heartbreaking Story". It should be obvious to everyone, what the site is all about, with many people even taking the hint that it is a Japanese, or at least Asian based stories.
        -   The website features a couple of additional pictures. The Story Page contains mostly historical pictures from the time period the story took place and the Media Page contains some book covers that feature drawn Akita dogs.
    -   #### Videos
        -   The site has 2 movies on the media page, one for each of the 2 movies that were made. They start playing once the user clicks on them and if they want to, they can go to the webpage they are hosted on (YouTube). Neither video does anything until it is clicked, just showing its basic thumbnail until the visitor interacts with it.
    -   #### Google Maps
        -   The Story Page has a Google Maps location implemented, where the Statue of Hachiko can be visited. It is styled to not have color (like the pictures on the main site), for consistent design.
